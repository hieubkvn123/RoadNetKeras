Change 1 :
 - Location : 74 - 77 file roadnet.py
 - Description : Modified the balanced crossentropy. Instead of 
 	using tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits, we use K.binary_crossentropy
	-> it turns out minimizing the effect of negative class loss is important

 - Effect : Now predicted map is less biased and started to predict both
 	negative and positive classes 

 - checkpoint file : model_1.weights.hdf5

Change 2 : 
 - Location : ver_3
 - Description : Similar to base training set but resolution equals 512 x 512 x 3
 - Effect : None
 - checkpoint file : ver_3/checkpoints/model_3.weights.hdf5



NOTE :
 - First backup : model_1.weightes.hdf5 to google drive
