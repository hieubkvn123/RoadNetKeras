 - Location : 74 - 77 file roadnet.py
 - Description : Modified the balanced crossentropy. Instead of 
 	using tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits, we use K.binary_crossentropy
	-> it turns out minimizing the effect of negative class loss is important

 - checkpoint file : model_1.weights.hdf5
