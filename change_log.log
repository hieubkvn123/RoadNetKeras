Change 1 :
 - Location : 74 - 77 file roadnet.py
 - Description : Modified the balanced crossentropy. Instead of 
 	using tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits, we use K.binary_crossentropy
	-> it turns out minimizing the effect of negative class loss is important

 - Effect : Now predicted map is less biased and started to predict both
 	negative and positive classes 

 - checkpoint file : model_1.weights.hdf5

 Change 2 :
  - Location : /ver_2
	- Description : Added a workspace to test out the second formula
	- Effect : it is converging like the original formula but slower and 
		fewer layers are optimized
	
	- checkpoint file : ver_2/checkpoints/model_1.weights.hdf5
